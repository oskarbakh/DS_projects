# Car price prediction

Predict a car price using dataset. Our goal here to achieve lowest RMSE as well as shortest time of calcultaing and tuning of the model.

Throughout the project have been done:

* dataset cleaning (outlier treatment, empty records treatment);
* Exploratory Data Analysis (correlations, statistical tests);
* dataset split/scaling;
* hyperparameters tuning for multiple models (CatBoost, XGBoost, LGBoost, Linear Regression);
* results analysis.
