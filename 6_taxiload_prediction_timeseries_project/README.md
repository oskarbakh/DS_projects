# Taxiload prediction 

Taxi company want to optimize its business so drivers work efficient. Therefore more drivers have to work when taxi demand is higher. We need to predict the demand in time.
Our goal is lowers RMSE. 

Throughout the project have been done:

* dataset cleaning (outlier treatment, empty records treatment);
* dataset split/scaling;
* stantionarity gained;
* prophet library has been used;
* LSTM neural net has been built;
* for ML methods features have been generated and hyperparameters tuned;
* results analysis.
