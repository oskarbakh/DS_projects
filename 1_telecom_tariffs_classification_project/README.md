# Telecom Tariffs Classification

Mobile operator would like to recommend one of two tariffs instead of archived ones. We have data about clients behavior to make such assumptions. Our main goal to achieve as high accuracy as possible.

Throughout the project have been done:
* Exploratory Data Analysis (correlations, statistical tests);
* dataset split;
* basic hyperparameters tuning.
