# Bank outflow project

Clients started to leave bank. It is cheaper and easier to save the clients than to attract new customers. There is a goal to predict whether customer leave or not for his additional stimulus. As a dataset we have got unbalanced Churn data. As main metric we should use f1 and AUC-ROC.

Throughout the project have been done:

* dataset cleaning (outlier treatment, empty records treatment);
* Exploratory Data Analysis (correlations, statistical tests);
* dataset split/scaling;
* basic hyperparameters tuning;
* results analysis.
